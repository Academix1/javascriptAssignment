# Prompt Engineering for Developers: Become a 10x Developer with ChatGPT

## Introduction

Imagine you have a super-smart friend who knows almost everything about coding, but they're very literal. They'll do exactly what you ask, no more, no less. That's ChatGPT! This course will teach you how to talk to this friend effectively, so they can help you become an amazing developer.

## Lesson 1: Understanding AI and ChatGPT

Think of ChatGPT as a huge library that's been speed-read by a super-fast reader. This reader can quickly find and combine information, but they don’t truly "understand" it like humans do.

- ChatGPT is trained on tons of text from the internet
- It predicts what word should come next based on the words you give it
- It doesn't have true understanding or reasoning, just really good pattern matching

**Exercise**: Ask ChatGPT to explain what it is. Notice how it describes itself.

## Lesson 2: Basic Principles of Prompt Engineering

### Clarity

Imagine you're giving directions to someone in a foreign country. You’d use simple words and clear instructions, right? That’s what we do with ChatGPT.

**Example**:  
Instead of: "Implement a sorting algorithm"  
Use: "Write a Python function that sorts a list of numbers from smallest to largest."

### Specificity

Think of ordering a custom pizza. The more details you give, the closer you’ll get to what you want.

**Example**:  
Instead of: "Create a web page"  
Use: "Create an HTML page with a header, navigation menu, main content area, and footer. Use CSS to style it with a blue color scheme."

### Context

Imagine jumping into the middle of a conversation. You’d be lost without context, right? Same for ChatGPT.

**Example**:  
"We're building a bookstore app. We need a function to calculate the total price of a customer's order, including a 10% discount for orders over $100."

### Format

Think of asking for directions. You might want them as a list, or as a drawn map. Specify how you want ChatGPT’s response.

**Example**:  
"Provide the solution as Python code, followed by a brief explanation of how it works."

**Exercise**: Write a prompt asking ChatGPT to create a function that checks if a number is prime. Think about language, inputs, outputs, and any edge cases.

## Lesson 3: Debugging with ChatGPT

Think of ChatGPT as a detective. You need to give it all the clues (error messages, code snippets) to solve the mystery (your bug).

### Key Points:
1. Provide the exact error message
2. Show the relevant code
3. Explain what you expected to happen
4. Ask for an explanation, not just a fix

**Example prompt**:  
"I'm getting an 'IndexError: list index out of range' with this Python code:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(numbers[3])
```
I expected it to print the fourth number. What's causing this error and how can I fix it?"

**Exercise**: Write a prompt to debug a function that's supposed to reverse a string but is producing unexpected output. Include example input and output.

## Lesson 4: ChatGPT for Code Generation

Imagine ChatGPT as a super-fast typist who knows every coding language. You just need to tell them exactly what to type.

### Key Points:
1. Specify the language
2. Describe functionality step-by-step
3. Mention any special requirements
4. Ask for comments or explanations

**Example prompt**:  
"Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list with all strings converted to uppercase. Include comments explaining each step."

**Exercise**: Write a prompt to generate a function that finds the longest word in a sentence. Consider punctuation and handling ties.

**Note**: Always review and understand the code generated by ChatGPT to ensure it fits well with the rest of your project.

## Lesson 5: Code Refactoring and Optimization

Imagine ChatGPT as a tidying expert for your code. It can reorganize and speed things up, but you need to tell it what to focus on.

### Key Points:
1. Provide the current code
2. Explain your goal (readability, performance, both?)
3. Mention any constraints
4. Ask for explanations of changes

**Example prompt**:  
"Refactor this Python code for better performance and explain each change:
```python
def find_duplicates(list1, list2):
    duplicates = []
    for item in list1:
        if item in list2:
            duplicates.append(item)
    return duplicates
```"

**Exercise**: Write a prompt to refactor a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. Ask for a more efficient iterative solution.

## Lesson 6: Documentation and Comments

Think of ChatGPT as your personal technical writer. It can explain your code to others (and your future self), but you need to guide its writing style.

### Key Points:
1. Specify the documentation style
2. Indicate the audience
3. Ask for examples
4. Request any necessary metadata

**Example prompt**:  
"Write a README.md file for a GitHub repository of a weather forecasting API. Include sections for installation, usage, endpoints, and example responses. The audience is other developers who might use this API."

**Exercise**: Write a prompt to create docstrings for a class that represents a bank account. Include methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking balance.
